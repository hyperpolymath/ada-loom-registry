= Spindle - Nickel Configuration Parser

*Note:* This directory is named `ada-loom-registry` but contains a Haskell project called "Spindle" - *not an Ada project*.

== What is Spindle?

A Haskell-based tool for parsing and evaluating Nickel configuration files. It reads `.ncl` files, evaluates them, and converts them to Haskell types via JSON.

== Technology Stack

- *Language:* Haskell (GHC 9.12.2)
- *Build System:* Cabal 2.2
- *Key Dependencies:*
  - `hnickel` - Nickel language integration
  - `aeson` - JSON parsing
  - `text` - Text handling
  - `bytestring` - Binary data

== Usage

```bash
cabal build
cabal run spindle -- path/to/config.ncl
```

== Configuration

- `config.ncl` - Nickel configuration
- `config.toml` - TOML configuration
- `.gitlab-ci.yml` - CI/CD pipeline

== Purpose

Processes Nickel configuration files to extract structured data (name, version) for use in Haskell applications.

== Status

- Version: 0.1.0.0
- License: BSD-3-Clause
- First version (see CHANGELOG.md)

== Development

The project appears to be in early development:
- Placeholder author/maintainer information
- GitHub URLs point to example repository
- Minimal changelog entry

== Recommendation

*This project should be renamed* to reflect its actual purpose:
- Current name: `ada-loom-registry` (misleading - not Ada, not a registry)
- Suggested names:
  - `spindle-nickel-parser`
  - `nickel-config-tools`
  - `spindle-haskell`
