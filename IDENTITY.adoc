== What This Project Is

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|*Name* |Spindle
|*Type* |Haskell library/CLI tool
|*Purpose* |Parse Nickel configuration files into type-safe Haskell data structures
|*Language* |Haskell (GHC 9.6+)
|*Key Dependency* |`hnickel` (Nickel language bindings)
|*Features* |Config parsing, validation, local config registry
|===

== What This Project Is NOT

* *NOT* an Ada programming language project
* *NOT* related to textile looms or weaving
* *NOT* a package registry (it has a local _config_ registry for managing validated configs)
* *NOT* related to the repository name `ada-loom-registry`

== Why The Confusing Repository Name?

The repository was created as `ada-loom-registry` as a placeholder before the project scope was defined. The name was a creative placeholder combining:

* "Ada" - a reference to Ada Lovelace (not the language)
* "Loom" - metaphor for weaving/combining (not textiles)
* "Registry" - original concept that was abandoned

The actual project that emerged is *Spindle*, which parses Nickel configs. The "spindle" name maintains the weaving metaphor (spindles are used in spinning thread) while accurately reflecting the tool's function.

== Repository Rename Plan

|===
|*Current* |`ada-loom-registry`
|*Target* |`spindle` or `spindle-nickel`
|*When* |Before v1.0.0 release
|===

The rename is pending because:

1. CI/CD pipelines currently reference the existing name
2. A potential merge with the `scaffoldia` project is under consideration
3. We want to choose a permanent name (avoiding multiple renames)

== Quick Reference

If you found this repository and are confused:

* *Looking for Ada code?* This isn't it.
* *Looking for a package registry?* This isn't it (but there is a config registry).
* *Looking for a Nickel config parser in Haskell?* You're in the right place.
