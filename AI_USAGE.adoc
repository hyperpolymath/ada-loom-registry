== Purpose of This Document

This document provides transparent disclosure of all AI usage in ada-loom-registry (Haskell 9.6.3 + Nickel parser).

== AI Tools Used

=== Claude Code (Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5)

**Tool:** Claude Code CLI v0.x
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
**Usage Period:** 2025-01-20 to present

**Primary Use Cases:**

1. **Infrastructure Setup** (Extensive)
   * Generated git hooks with Haskell + Nickel checks
   * Created CI/CD pipelines for Cabal builds with Nickel validation
   * Generated 4 Nickel configuration files
   * Created .tool-versions for GHC 9.6.3, Cabal, Nickel
   * Generated Haskell-specific dotfiles

2. **Rhodium Compliance** (Extensive)
   * Created .rhodium/ structure (LEVEL, WAIVER.adoc, compliance.json)
   * Identified 2 Markdown files for conversion
   * Documented native Nickel usage advantage (exceeds Rhodium requirement!)
   * Generated this AI_USAGE.adoc

3. **Nickel Integration**
   * Documented Nickel parser FFI boundaries
   * Created WASM + Nickel FFI testing strategy
   * Noted GHC 9.6.3 wasm32-wasi advantage over GHC 9.4.8

**Human Oversight:** All generated content reviewed. Haskell and Nickel integration code 100% human-written.

== AI-Generated vs Human-Written Content

=== 100% AI-Generated (Reviewed by Human)

* Git hooks and CI/CD pipelines
* Nickel configuration files
* .rhodium/ compliance structure
* Infrastructure automation
* This AI_USAGE.adoc

=== 100% Human-Written

* All Haskell source code
* Nickel parser integration
* Registry operations logic
* Configuration validation rules
* Architectural decisions

== Nickel-Specific AI Advantages

=== Native Typed Configuration

**Rhodium Advantage:** ada-loom-registry uses Nickel natively for configuration, EXCEEDING Rhodium requirement.

**AI Contribution:**

* AI documented that ada-loom-registry already exceeds Rhodium Standard's typed configuration requirement (Pillar 2, Section 2.2.9)
* Generated compliance.json highlighting this advantage
* Documented Nickel parser FFI boundaries for WASM strategy

**Compliance Note:** This gives ada-loom-registry a head start on Rhodium compliance compared to projects needing to add Nickel.

=== GHC 9.6.3 WASM Support

**WASM Advantage:** GHC 9.6.3 has wasm32-wasi support (unlike scaffoldia's GHC 9.4.8).

**AI Contribution:** AI documented that ada-loom-registry is better positioned for WASM compliance than scaffoldia.

== Haskell-Specific AI Considerations

=== Markdown Migration (Low Effort)

Only 2 Markdown files to convert:

1. README.md → README.adoc
2. CHANGELOG.md → CHANGELOG.adoc

**AI Strategy:** Automated conversion with pandoc, minimal human cleanup needed.

== Training Data Considerations

**Haskell + Nickel:**

* AI trained on Hackage and Nickel documentation
* Nickel is newer language (AI knowledge may be limited)
* Mitigation: Human expertise on Nickel parser integration

== Ethical Considerations

=== Configuration Registry

* No user data collection (registry tool)
* PRIVACY.adoc: Not applicable (noted in compliance.json)

== Contact

Questions about AI usage:

* Open an issue with label: `ai-transparency`
* See CONTRIBUTING.adoc
