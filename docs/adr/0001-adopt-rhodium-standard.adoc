== Context

ada-loom-registry (Haskell + Nickel parser) requires compliance with advantage of native Nickel usage (exceeds Rhodium requirement).

== Decision

We adopt Rhodium Standard 0.5, targeting Silver level.

**Native Nickel Advantage:** Already uses Nickel for configuration, exceeding Rhodium typed config requirement!

**GHC 9.6.3 Advantage:** Has wasm32-wasi support (unlike scaffoldia's 9.4.8).

== Consequences

* ✅ Native Nickel usage exceeds Rhodium standard
* ✅ GHC 9.6.3 WASM support available
* ✅ Only 2 Markdown files to convert (low effort)
